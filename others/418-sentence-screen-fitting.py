'''
Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented by a list of non-empty words, find how many times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.

A word cannot be split into two lines.
The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged.
Two consecutive words in a line must be separated by a single space.
Total words in the sentence won't exceed 100.
Length of each word is greater than 0 and won't exceed 10.
1 â‰¤ rows, cols â‰¤ 20,000.
