Design an ordered task list system with a server and multiple clients. 
Implementation functions: (1). insert into the task list (2). remove from the list (3). 
move one task to a different place in the list, as soon as possible. 
A brief description of the API, how to handle the conflicts between different users. 
i.e. What happens when a client in the remove while another client moves the same task?
