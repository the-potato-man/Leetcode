Given a contiguous sequence of numbers in which each number repeats thrice, there is exactly one missing number. Find the missing number.
eg: 11122333 : Missing number 2
11122233344455666 Missing number 5

Given a compressed string in which a number followed by [] indicate how many times those characters occur, decompress the string
Eg. : a3[b2[c1[d]]]e will be decompressed as abcdcdbcdcdbcdcde.
Assume the string is well formed and number will always be followed by a [].

Given a tree representation of a html parsed output, wherein every block is a node in the tree, find if two html docs contain the same text.

struct Node {
       string value;
       bool isMetadata;
       vector<Node*> children;
};
For eg, consider the two documents

sample

Hello world

will be represented as Node1: value sample, children: isMetadata: true Node2: value: children:

isMetadata: true Node3: value:

: children: Hello world isMetadata: true Node4: value Hello world isMetadata: false

and a second document

Hello world

and both documents are equivalent since they contain the same data.

Note: the case of both documents fitting in memory is trivial, since it is just walking this tree list, consolidating data and comparing. 
As a follow up, solve the case where the whole documents may not be able to fit in memory.
4. Given a 2D matrix M X N, support two operations:
Query(row1, col1, row2, col2) such that I get the sum of all numbers in the rectangle ((row1, col1), (row1, col2), (row2, col1), (row2, col2)) and
Update(row, col) to a new number

And query is a very frequent operation and update is a rare operation, so query should be really fast, but update can be slower.

Follow up: How would you solve this in a distributed fashion

Verify if a given matrix is a Toeplitz matrix:
Follow up, assume that the whole matrix cannot be fit in memory and should be read from a file, 
assume that a few rows and all columns can be read in, how to verify?
