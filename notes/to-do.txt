Given a tree representation of a html parsed output, wherein every block is a node in the tree, find if two html docs contain the same text.

struct Node {
       string value;
       bool isMetadata;
       vector<Node*> children;
};
For eg, consider the two documents

sample
Hello world
will be represented as Node1: value sample, children: isMetadata: true Node2: value: children:
isMetadata: true Node3: value:
: children: Hello world isMetadata: true Node4: value Hello world isMetadata: false
and a second document
Hello world
and both documents are equivalent since they contain the same data.

Note: the case of both documents fitting in memory is trivial, since it is just walking this tree list, consolidating data and comparing. 
As a follow up, solve the case where the whole documents may not be able to fit in memory.
4. Given a 2D matrix M X N, support two operations:
Query(row1, col1, row2, col2) such that I get the sum of all numbers in the rectangle ((row1, col1), (row1, col2), (row2, col1), (row2, col2)) and
Update(row, col) to a new number

And query is a very frequent operation and update is a rare operation, so query should be really fast, but update can be slower.

Follow up: How would you solve this in a distributed fashion

Verify if a given matrix is a Toeplitz matrix:
Follow up, assume that the whole matrix cannot be fit in memory and should be read from a file, 
assume that a few rows and all columns can be read in, how to verify?
